## Self Portrait
#### by Natalie Morris



### Overview
Self portrait using organic forms and imagery in p5.js for Interaction Design.

### Technical Details
Uses draw function to perform a series of functions that create a face using organic p5 shapes, lines, and curves, along with color variables that change when the mouse is pressed.

Project folder includes p5 sketch to perform the functions, the original hand-drawn sketch jpg, a visualization of how I wanted the p5 sketch to look, and two screenshots of the output.
